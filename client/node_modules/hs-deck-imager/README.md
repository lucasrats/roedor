# Hearthstone Deck Imager

Convert Hearthstone deckstrings into images similar to what would be displayed 
in Hearthstone.

### Installation

Simply run 
`
npm install --save hs-deck-imager
`

The installation includes all necessary fonts, card tiles, and the latest
version of cards.collectible.json.

### Usage

After importing the module, using imageFromDeckstring will generate an image
file given a deckstring and destination file path. 

For example,

```javascript
const DeckImager = require('hs-deck-imager');

const imgPath = 'example.jpg';

let resultPath = DeckImager.imageFromDeckstring(
  'AAECAaIHBLICrwTtBYHCAg20AYwCzQO9BJsFiAekB90Ihgn1uwLrwgLc0QLb4wIA',
  imgPath
);

if(imgPath !== resultPath){
  // an error occurred; handle as you like
}
```
This will created an image at the given path. For the above command, the following
output was generated:
![Example Deck Output](https://github.com/ZacheryJohnson/hs-deck-imager/blob/master/example.jpg)
